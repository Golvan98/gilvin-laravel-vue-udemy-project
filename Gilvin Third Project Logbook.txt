- created SSH Key (VERY IMPORTANT in order to push commits). git is online for the project as of now.

- Done doing Setting p views part 1

ls
cd
git init
git remote add origin [gitLink]
git remote -v
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
git push origin master

^git bash commands for uploading files to github. gitlink is SSH link not HTTPS since HTTPS key sucks ass.

- Created Layouts from app.js file

- Learned about Persistent Layout, timer of current session using inertia and vue

when importing shit, usage of directory address like '../../Layouts/MainLayout.vue'; is different depending on 
which folder u are currently in. ../.. when in another folder, and './MainLayout.Vue when in the same folder? idk

- ^Issue above is fixed using jsconfig, u can just sort of use @/ to locate stuff u u want to import

- added await and assync on the const pages in app.js, idk about what the fuck it does since nothing changed but I'll play it safe and  do it anyway
