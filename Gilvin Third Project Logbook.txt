- created SSH Key (VERY IMPORTANT in order to push commits). git is online for the project as of now.

- Done doing Setting p views part 1

ls
cd
git init
git remote add origin [gitLink]
git remote -v
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
git push origin master

^git bash commands for uploading files to github. gitlink is SSH link not HTTPS since HTTPS key sucks ass.

- Established vuejs environment in project file

- Created first  "SPA" type landing pages

Feb 08:

- Created Layouts from app.js file

- Learned about Persistent Layout, timer of current session using inertia and vue

when importing shit, usage of directory address like '../../Layouts/MainLayout.vue'; is different depending on 
which folder u are currently in. ../.. when in another folder, and './MainLayout.Vue when in the same folder? idk

- ^Issue above is fixed using jsconfig, u can just sort of use @/ to locate stuff u u want to import

- added await and assync on the const pages in app.js, idk about what the fuck it does since nothing changed but I'll play it safe and  do it anyway

Feb 09:

- Database factory/seeders

Fab 20:

- where() in DB Queries combines parameters with the AND operator, which means 
it must be this and that, not this OR that

- Created resource controlls and limited with ->Only['index' , 'show'] feature.

- Docker port someohw conflicts with git ports (unable to push commits while docker is connected)

- Link->controller->web is somewhat lacking, revisit v-for and route section tomorrow. A battle lost is
not a war lost = ) gj gj gl

Feb 21: Resuming controller->route issue

- Fixed the issue, its the--> ' <-- that shit. vue prefers --> ` <-- instead of --> ' <-- this
now you gotta copy ` everytime u refer variables in hrefs. !!!IMPORTANT!!

- Added components folder in js folders

- Inertia issue. Syntax is fucking new and not the same again, will try tomorrow. Sigh. Redo forms section

Feb 22: Resuming Syntax issue in form.post inertia

Feb 26:

- in centrio's starbucks shit lol

- confirmed the create button using vue form works, but flash message unsuccessful.

- failed at debugging flash message, will try more options next time

- managed to make ziggy work somehow. Flash message bug is still persistent tho. 
- href links are now in route names. will do a commit now
- flash message still bugged. idk. best move on maybe there are better ways to do this

March 10:
- tried to solve that delete shit, still nada.
- Configured tailwind into the project. yey.
- fixed the Fucking flash bug. It's '@inertiajs/inertia-vue3' NOT THIS import {Link} from '@inertiajs/vue3' . 
as to why it works on edit/create and not on delete, idk. wtf.
- Cleaned up some code. Better to go to github and copy what's what if you're having problems, you'll figure
what's wrong faster anyways. U did good, ziggy installation problem was worse and u solved it faster than this

March 15:
- Grids using vue and tailwind
- <span> doesnt take a whole  element unlike div
- used span as a sort of header and inserted it on top of the listings UI
