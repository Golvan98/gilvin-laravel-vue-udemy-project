- created SSH Key (VERY IMPORTANT in order to push commits). git is online for the project as of now.

- Done doing Setting p views part 1

ls
cd
git init
git remote add origin [gitLink]
git remote -v
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
git push origin master

^git bash commands for uploading files to github. gitlink is SSH link not HTTPS since HTTPS key sucks ass.


Feb 07: 

- Setup project link in github, created first commit

- Setup vue config in package json. 

- Established vuejs environment in project file

- Created first  "SPA" type landing pages

Feb 08:

- Created Layouts from app.js file

- Learned about Persistent Layout, timer of current session using inertia and vue

when importing shit, usage of directory address like '../../Layouts/MainLayout.vue'; is different depending on 
which folder u are currently in. ../.. when in another folder, and './MainLayout.Vue when in the same folder? idk

- ^Issue above is fixed using jsconfig, u can just sort of use @/ to locate stuff u u want to import

- added await and assync on the const pages in app.js, idk about what the fuck it does since nothing changed but I'll play it safe and  do it anyway

Feb 09:

- stuck with this port conflict shit. Xampp conflicts with docker desktop adminer and creates errors.

- Reinstall php tomorrow. You're done. We lost today xd

Feb 15:

- Solved the route problems, uninstalled xampp to remove port conflicts.

- Stuck with the extension PDO error in php. Will try tomorrow.

Feb 16:

- Solved the extenion pdo error problem, php.ini created by the php installation folder is not recognized, 
gotta make one on ur own. what a bummer, those cunts

- Added first migration table, and feature such as dropColumn. fought well today. gg.

Feb 17:

- Database factory/seeders

Fab 20:

- where() in DB Queries combines parameters with the AND operator, which means 
it must be this and that, not this OR that

- Created resource controlls and limited with ->Only['index' , 'show'] feature.

- Docker port someohw conflicts with git ports (unable to push commits while docker is connected)

- Link->controller->web is somewhat lacking, revisit v-for and route section tomorrow. A battle lost is
not a war lost = ) gj gj gl

Feb 21: Resuming controller->route issue

- Fixed the issue, its the--> ' <-- that shit. vue prefers --> ` <-- instead of --> ' <-- this
now you gotta copy ` everytime u refer variables in hrefs. !!!IMPORTANT!!

- Added components folder in js folders

- Inertia issue. Syntax is fucking new and not the same again, will try tomorrow. Sigh. Redo forms section

Feb 22: Resuming Syntax issue in form.post inertia

- Figured out the problem, it's those extra syntax PhpStorm indicator creates in the OL Course. BEWARE of those shts

Feb 23:

- flash message not showing, piece of shit using different snytax again =) wcyd

Feb 26:

- in centrio's starbucks shit lol

- confirmed the create button using vue form works, but flash message unsuccessful.

- failed at debugging flash message, will try more options next time

Feb 28:

- fixed the flash message, turns out you don't need the $ prefix and .value syntax anymore. these assholes
are never really accurate with their syntax. Sigh 

March 02:

- Backend and Frontend Form Validation Complete
- First attempt at Edit Forms using vue/inertia
- Finished Edit Form using vue/inertia

March 07:

- Working Delete but no flash message yet
- Debugging flash message failed, will try again tomorrow. sadge.

March 09:

- switched coding hours to morning around 9-12
- installed ziggy, solved issue where it cannot launch composer require tightenco/ziggy via --ignore-platform-req=ext-fileinfo
- ^issue above is I'm not entirely sure if it's working yet. these dependencies... zz
- managed to make ziggy work somehow. Flash message bug is still persistent tho. 
- href links are now in route names. will do a commit now
- flash message still bugged. idk. best move on maybe there are better ways to do this

March 10:
- tried to solve that delete shit, still nada.
- Configured tailwind into the project. yey.
- fixed the Fucking flash bug. It's '@inertiajs/inertia-vue3' NOT THIS import {Link} from '@inertiajs/vue3' . 
as to why it works on edit/create and not on delete, idk. wtf.
- Cleaned up some code. Better to go to github and copy what's what if you're having problems, you'll figure
what's wrong faster anyways. U did good, ziggy installation problem was worse and u solved it faster than this

March 15:
- Grids using vue and tailwind
- <span> doesnt take a whole  element unlike div
- used span as a sort of header and inserted it on top of the listings UI
- to use only 1 root element (div) to pass CSS classes onto component/vues, otherwise vue will ignore it
- added Price component that converts currency from ComputedProperties using localeString function

March 21:
- styled show page using div class box and template
- styed form using tailwind

March 22:
- directives @apply for repetitive classes in tailwind
- Progress bar done but it was built in already, idk when I added this, might have came with the package
of all the other npm shits I did.
- directive for error messages created
- UI for range type of input
- working calculator logic for price per monthy/interest payment

March 23:
- created a reusable logic for useMonthlyPayment
- tried to use useMonthlyPayment in index page, doesnt work. another syntax issue. zz

March 24:

- added more composable formula(members) such as totalInterest and principal Paid to listing profile
- added auth controller for login/register
- added Login form
- TAKE NOTE of script setups, form@submit.prevent="methodname(login)" and v-model in vue
WHENEVER YOU USE FORMS
- TAKENOTE: session regenerate is important
- TAKENOTE: sessions in PHP usually expires after 24mins of inactivity, but cookies and remember me options
can make a user authenticated indefinitely
- added login with Authentication logic in Auth Controller

March 28:

- added error messages after authentication process
- TAKENOTE: u need const props = defineProps({ errors:Object}) since the syntax is now errors.email/password/username instead of form.errors.username
- Added showing the current logged in user feature
- TAKENOTE: current syntax for const variable = computed (() => page.props.user) AND IT IS NOT page.props.value.user as older versions suggest
- added an if and else in the feature in MainLayout view where it shows sign in button for non-authenticated users and other features if user is authenticated
- added logout feature for both frontend and backend. there's a weird bug where it still shows the buttons though
- TAKENOTE: csrf is a protection one must have for every form to avoid easy attacks. If you're using inertia, this stuff is generated automatically whereas before 
when you were using blade u had to put @csrf for every method u have.

March 29:
- Added middleware
- TAKENOTE: middlewares can be added in controller like this
 public function __construct()
    {
        $this->middleware('auth')->except('index', 'show');
    }
BUTTTTT I think it's much easier to add middlewares through in the routes in web.php like this

Route::resource('listing' , ListingController::class)->only(['create', 'store', 'edit', 'update', 'destroy'])->middleware('auth');
Route::resource('listing', ListingController::class)->except(['create', 'store', 'edit', 'update', 'destroy']);

- added create form

- added create controller & register function

- TAKENOTE: created a mutator that hashes password for a user attribute. u do it like this
protected function password(): Attribute
    {
        return Attribute::make(
            get: fn($value) => $value,
            set: fn($value) => Hash::make($value)
        );
    }

- TAKENOTE: function name should be camelcase of the kebab-cased attribute. say "user-name" as an attribute should be named "userName" as function name

- added Link ref UI for create and login route
- added exemption to CSRF 24min timer for logout

March 30:
- added relations to Listing/Users. HasMany and belongsTo
- added a by_user_id attribute to listings table
- TAKENOTE: there are many ways to connect data from 1 to the other and u tinker with them according to their relationship names in model. 

For Ex. $listing10 = listing::find(10). U associate it to user 2 using $listing->owner()->associate($user2);

Ex. for the other way around is $user2->listings()->save($listing10);

Another Ex. is $listing10->by_user_id = 2;

- found a login/logout inconsistency, and buttons are still showing after logout. must fix soon.
- First Encounter with custom policies. will grind through it tomorrow. Great work Today gilvs

March 31:
- added policy, yet to understand it fully
- added "?" before view Policies so it would allow guests to view certain pages
- configured policy in which only the by_user_id can edit/delete/restore listings. doesnt work on delete tho idk why
- TAKENOTE: $user->listings loads all the listings related to user. $user->listings() allows u to build queries like ->where('id' 1 yada yada) and you'd have to call the get() method
in the end. just like what you did in ur thesis project
- added pagination and pagination links using vue. 
- TAKENOTE: Noticed A lot of hokus pokus with "v-for" (these are just props if u're using blade) if you're using vue. 


April 6:

- added filter UI, logic not yet integrated
- added props in prepartion for filter logic, clear button is now working and props persist when page is refreshed April 06

April 7:
- Added a scopeMostRecent function in listing Models, TAKENOTE: u can kill this method for almost any custom function u created, say for example, ranking by price or by id => u make a function called ->LowestPrice() and sht
- migrated filter backend algo to Models and created custom scope Functions in the Listing Models class

May 3:
- came back from unsolicited 3 weeks break. 1st week was on overtime from the other job, the other 2 weeks i was sick. sadge.
- Moved Realtor folder deeper into js/Pages folder, it was js/Realtor before, its default pathfinding directory is js/Pages, TIL.
- NOTE: remember to always specfy a key in v-fors
- NOTE: Frontend part, u can specify if a screen is minimized like medium size by md:flex-row, this works as an "if(screensize=medium/small/large)" then it renders that part of the css only
- added new format and preview/edit/delete buttons in Realtor/Index view
- added softdeletes feature/migration
- NOTE: if u sticked to the naming convention in ListingPolicy and Resource sht, they can be carried to into controllers , u just need to build a construct in the controller.
- migrated a construct and policy from Listong to Realtor Controller that limits a user to be able to delete only the listings he/she created


May 5:
- added checkbox button filter for Deleted
- added watcher function 
- NOTE: when passing routes in watch, u import router, not inertia, 
and origin of import is '@inertiajs/vue3' , not '@inertia/inertia'
- NOTE: when importing a wrong/unused library in script, the page malfunctions entirely
- added debounce feature
- added a filter feature for deleted listings using softdeletequery "withTrashed()"
- added backend part for filtering by attributes and setting constraints on which parts can be sorted

May 8:
- added filter, code copied associated frontend-backend, must review both backend and frontend May 8
- added default filter values when entering page, kinda clunky due to version syntax changes tho. May 8
- added pagination May 8
- migrated backend of page routing and controllers from Listing to Realtor, 
this way some features like edit, create, delete is now exclusive for realtor/owner accounts May 8
- NOTE: adding ":" like :class="{'border-dashed':listing.deleted_at}" is a conditional class, wherein 
in this code snippet it applies dashed borders IF listing.delete_at is true
- NOTE: adding ->withTrashed() in web.php routers enable u to include soft deleted objects in ur queries for show/edit/update
named routes. u can also specify certain route names while calling it in web.php
- NOTE: Route::prefix('enter prefix here') immediately adds the entered prefix into route names
- added restore feature, delete filter is not working as intended, will debug next session
