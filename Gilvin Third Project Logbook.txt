- created SSH Key (VERY IMPORTANT in order to push commits). git is online for the project as of now.

- Done doing Setting p views part 1

ls
cd
git init
git remote add origin [gitLink]
git remote -v
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
git push origin master

^git bash commands for uploading files to github. gitlink is SSH link not HTTPS since HTTPS key sucks ass.


Feb 07: 

- Setup project link in github, created first commit

- Setup vue config in package json. 

- Established vuejs environment in project file

- Created first  "SPA" type landing pages

Feb 08:

- Created Layouts from app.js file

- Learned about Persistent Layout, timer of current session using inertia and vue

when importing shit, usage of directory address like '../../Layouts/MainLayout.vue'; is different depending on 
which folder u are currently in. ../.. when in another folder, and './MainLayout.Vue when in the same folder? idk

- ^Issue above is fixed using jsconfig, u can just sort of use @/ to locate stuff u u want to import

- added await and assync on the const pages in app.js, idk about what the fuck it does since nothing changed but I'll play it safe and  do it anyway

Feb 09:

- stuck with this port conflict shit. Xampp conflicts with docker desktop adminer and creates errors.

- Reinstall php tomorrow. You're done. We lost today xd
